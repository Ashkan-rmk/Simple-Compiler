# Simple Recursive Decsent Parser
#### The academic two-phases of a Compiler with these features:

A Program to make `NFA` from `Regular Expression` and make it to `DFA` then simplify it!
After these steps, The` Recursive Decsent Parser` will get this `DFA` and a Source Code of `pascal program`.
The parser make abstract syntax tree (AST) and detect errors of pascal program.
